Run 'atomic_simulation.py' to perform the simulations of heels as particles, interacting via circular forces (used in Fig. 7C).

All parameters are given in the dictionary PARAMS. 

Creates a movie of the interacting heels if create_movie == True.

Otherwise, returns the locations of the heels and the angles between R2 and R5 of the same bundle. 

Requires NumPy and Matplotlib.
